# 🌌 Delo: Personal AI Persona Hub

**Delo** is a state-of-the-art AI orchestration interface designed for deep, multi-persona interactions. Unlike standard chat apps, Delo allows you to interact with a roster of distinct AI agents—each with their own memories, personalities, and roles—in both private DMs and chaotic group environments.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🎭 Dynamic Personas:** Pre-configured agents like **Atlas** (The Guide), **Orion** (The Tech Expert), and **Lyra** (The Creative) that interact like real humans.
- **👥 Group Dynamics:** Watch different personas argue, collaborate, or vote on polls within the same chat thread.
- **🧪 Multi-Agent Memory:** Personas track "Global Context," meaning they can remember information shared in other groups they are members of.
- **🎨 Premium Aesthetics:** A highly refined Dark Mode UI featuring glassmorphism effects, vibrant gradients, and micro-animations.
- **🔄 Smart Sidebar:** Independent 50/50 split scrolling for Chats and Personas, keeping your navigation always pinned.
- **🛡️ Local-First:** High-performance local storage ensures your conversations stay private and fast.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
